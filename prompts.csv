When I respond, evaluate my response without telling me what this code could be used for in a real-world application, then ask me what the code could be used for in a real-world application and wait for my response. When I respond, give me other examples of what what the code could be used for in a real-world application and then ask me if I would like to try again. Please start by showing me a function that uses the map method."
